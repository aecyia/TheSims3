In-General
	+	Skill Journal Tabs
		+	Overcrowding is an issue because the tabs overlap one another and produces inefficient and difficult access

	+	World Editor
		+	Already implemented without needing a different application to edit the World
		+	Not really a high priority but would be cool
	+	Optimization
		+	If updated past 2021+, the game would be SO much cleaner, simpler, smaller, faster, efficient, etc.

	+	The hardest achievement is "10 to the 4th Simoleons"
		+	Earn 10,000 Simoleons by correlating Scientific Data
		+	This is the most difficult because:
			+	Only once or twice a day ( 12 hours per action ) at the Science Center
			+	Gives around 10 to 180 Simoleons per visit
				+	Usually around 10 to 45 Simoleons
			+	Very time-consuming for little return
			+	Only available for one Sim's progress and is not available for multiple Sims' progress
	+	The second hardest achievement is "10 for 100"
		+	Sell 10 blogs for at least 100 Simoleons each
		+	Can't sell blogs unless the blog has enough followers and stars ( 5 Stars max is over 1000 followers )
		+	Gaining followers is difficult; Can get "Blogged Out"; Can lose followers
		+	Time-consuming to gain followers for 10 blogs
